Create a dist/index.html. Import your main.js in the body.
You must use jQuery to add the elements to the body of the page.
When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a dist folder.
You should not use a custom webpack config file.
Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack).
Do NOT push your dist/main.js if you have one.
